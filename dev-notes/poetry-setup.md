The error you're seeing when running `poetry install` indicates that Poetry cannot find the `python` executable it's supposed to use. This could be due to several reasons, such as an improperly configured environment, issues with how Python paths are being set, or problems within the virtual environment itself.

Hereâ€™s how to address the issue:

### 1. Verify Python Installation
First, make sure Python is installed correctly and accessible from your terminal. Run:

```bash
python --version
```
or
```bash
python3 --version
```

If these commands return an error, Python may not be installed properly, or the path to Python is not included in your system's PATH environment variable.

### 2. Check Virtual Environment
Ensure that your virtual environment is activated and configured to use the correct Python version. When a virtual environment is active, running `python --version` should show the Python version that the virtual environment is using. If this isn't the case, you might need to recreate your virtual environment:

```bash
deactivate  # If the current environment is still active, deactivate it first
python3 -m venv /path/to/new/venv
source /path/to/new/venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Configure Poetry to Use the Correct Python Version
With the virtual environment activated, configure Poetry to use the Python version that the virtual environment is using:

```bash
poetry env use python3
```

This command tells Poetry to use the Python executable named `python3` within the current environment.

### 4. Install Dependencies with Poetry
Once the correct Python version is set up and recognized by Poetry, try installing your dependencies again:

```bash
poetry install
```

### 5. Managing PYTHONPATH
You've tried to set the `PYTHONPATH` to include your module directory, but if it's set incorrectly (as in your second export command using `"./:$PYTHONPATH"`), it might not work as expected. Ensure that the path you add to `PYTHONPATH` is the absolute path to the directory containing your Python modules or packages. For example:

```bash
export PYTHONPATH="/absolute/path/to/your/module:$PYTHONPATH"
```

### 6. Update Shell Configuration (Optional)
If you're using `bash` and want to automatically set these environment variables each time you open a terminal, you can add the export commands to your `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.bashrc` (create it if it doesn't exist):

```bash
echo 'export PYTHONPATH="/absolute/path/to/your/module:$PYTHONPATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile
```

This command adds the export to your profile and sources it.

### Conclusion
These steps should help you resolve the error with Poetry and ensure that your Python and Poetry setup is correctly configured to manage dependencies for your project. If the issue persists, double-check the paths and ensure all configurations are pointing to the correct locations.

## Running the application
```
poetry run uvicorn app.application:app --reload
```


## Debugging environment setup with poetry
The errors you're encountering when trying to run your `application.py` script relate to Python's module resolution system and the environments being used. Let's break down the issues and clarify why they're happening:

### Error 1: ModuleNotFoundError for `fastapi`
**Command**: `python3 app/application.py`

**Error**:
```bash
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fastapi'
```

**Cause**: This error suggests that when you run the script with `python3` directly from your system shell (not using Poetry to invoke the script), Python is not using the virtual environment where `fastapi` is installed. This is common when:
- The system's default Python interpreter (which `python3` refers to) is used, and it does not have access to the libraries installed in the virtual environment managed by Poetry.
- The virtual environment where `fastapi` is installed isn't activated, or `python3` isn't linked to this virtual environment.

### Error 2: ModuleNotFoundError for `app`
**Command**: `poetry run python3 app/application.py`

**Error**:
```bash
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'app'
```

**Cause**: This error indicates that when running the script under Poetry's managed environment, Python can't resolve the `app` module. This typically happens because:
- The script is being executed in a manner where the Python interpreter's current directory (cwd) context is such that it doesn't recognize `app` as a package or a module.
- There might be missing `__init__.py` files in the `app` directory or its parent directory to indicate to Python that these should be treated as packages.

### Solutions:

This is what worked for me: 
```bash
source $(poetry env info --path)/bin/activate
python3 app/application.py # Make sure that you can run the app

export PYTHONPATH="$(poetry env info --path)/lib/python3.12/site-packages":$PYTHONPATH
poetry run uvicorn app.application:application --reload

```


#### For the `fastapi` Error:
1. **Activate the Poetry Environment Manually** before running the script with `python3`. You can do this by:
   ```bash
   source $(poetry env info --path)/bin/activate
   python3 app/application.py
   ```
   This ensures you're using the correct environment that has `fastapi` installed.

2. **Always Use Poetry to Run Your Python Scripts** within the project to ensure consistency with dependencies:
   ```bash
   poetry run python3 app/application.py
   ```

#### For the `app` Error:
1. **Ensure Proper Package Structure**: Make sure there is an `__init__.py` file in every directory you want Python to treat as a package (including the `app` directory and potentially its parent directory if needed).

2. **Adjust Python Path or Use Relative Imports**:
   - If `application.py` is running from within the `app` directory and trying to import other modules or packages at the same level or subdirectories, you might need to adjust the imports to be relative (using dot notation like `.module_name` or `..parent_module_name`) or manipulate `sys.path` to include the parent directory of `app`.
   - Modify the Python path temporarily when invoking the script:
     ```bash
     PYTHONPATH=/path/to/your/project_root poetry run python3 app/application.py
     ```

3. **Check Current Working Directory**:
   - Make sure you run the script from the project root directory:
     ```bash
     cd /path/to/your/project_root
     poetry run python3 app/application.py
     ```

4. **Debug the Path Issues**:
   - Add debug prints in your script to output the current working directory and `sys.path` to understand where Python is looking for modules:
     ```python
     import os
     import sys
     print("CWD:", os.getcwd())
     print("sys.path:", sys.path)
     ```

By ensuring consistency in how you invoke your Python environment and scripts, and by setting up your Python environment and directory structure correctly, you should be able to avoid these errors.
