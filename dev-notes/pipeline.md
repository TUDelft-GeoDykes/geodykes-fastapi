# Approach to develop the pipeline
Create a separate folder for the pipeline as a separate module of app, at the root folder.

## Approach 1: Strategy design pattern
To approach this problem, I would use the Strategy design pattern. The Strategy pattern is useful when you want to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. In this context, the different structures of data (i.e., different columns in different CSV files) can be handled by different strategies for loading the data.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Define an interface (abstract class) for the loading strategy**: This will define the method that each concrete strategy must implement.
2. **Implement concrete strategies for different data structures**: Each concrete strategy will handle the specific structure of a given data source.
3. **Use a context class to interact with the strategy**: This class will use a strategy to load the data.

Here's how you could implement this:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
import csv
from sqlalchemy import  Column, Integer, String, DateTime, JSON, ForeignKey


# Interface for the loading strategy
class LoadStrategy(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def load(self, file_path):
        pass

# Concrete strategy for loading data with structure 1
class LoadStrategyStructure1(LoadStrategy):
    def load(self, file_path):
        with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
            reader = csv.DictReader(file)
            for row in reader:
                # Assuming structure: id, crossection_id, location, unit_id, sensor_type_id, value, time
                read = Reading(
                    crossection_id=row['crossection_id'],
                    location_in_topology={"location": row['location']},
                    unit_id=row['unit_id'],
                    sensor_type_id=row['sensor_type_id'],
                    value=row['value'],
                    time=row['time']
                )
                session.add(read)
            session.commit()

# Concrete strategy for loading data with structure 2
class LoadStrategyStructure2(LoadStrategy):
    def load(self, file_path):
        with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
            reader = csv.DictReader(file)
            for row in reader:
                # Assuming structure: id, cross_id, loc, unit, sensor, reading_value, timestamp
                read = Reading(
                    crossection_id=row['cross_id'],
                    location_in_topology={"location": row['loc']},
                    unit_id=row['unit'],
                    sensor_type_id=row['sensor'],
                    value=row['reading_value'],
                    time=row['timestamp']
                )
                session.add(read)
            session.commit()

# Context class
class DataLoader:
    def __init__(self, strategy: LoadStrategy):
        self.strategy = strategy

    def load_data(self, file_path):
        self.strategy.load(file_path)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    Base.metadata.create_all(engine)

    # Choose a strategy based on the structure of your CSV file
    data_loader = DataLoader(LoadStrategyStructure1())
    data_loader.load_data('data1.csv')

    data_loader = DataLoader(LoadStrategyStructure2())
    data_loader.load_data('data2.csv')
```

### Explanation:

1. **Abstract Class (Interface)**: `LoadStrategy` defines the interface for the loading strategy.
2. **Concrete Strategies**: `LoadStrategyStructure1` and `LoadStrategyStructure2` implement the loading logic for different data structures.
3. **Context Class**: `DataLoader` uses a strategy to load the data. It is initialized with a specific strategy and uses it to load data from a given file path.

This design allows you to easily extend the system to handle new data structures by implementing new strategies without modifying the existing code.

## Approach 2: Standardize the data before loading 
Certainly! Standardizing the data before loading it involves transforming various data structures into a common format that can be processed uniformly. This approach contrasts with the Strategy pattern, where different strategies handle different data structures separately. Let's explore this approach with an example and compare it with the Strategy pattern.

### Standardization Approach

In this approach, we create a function that standardizes the data from different structures into a common format. Once standardized, the data can be processed uniformly.

```python
import csv

# Function to standardize data from structure 1
def standardize_structure1(row):
    return {
        "id": row["ID"],
        "value": row["Value"],
        "timestamp": row["Timestamp"],
        "unit": row["Unit"]
    }

# Function to standardize data from structure 2
def standardize_structure2(row):
    return {
        "id": row["Identifier"],
        "value": row["Measurement"],
        "timestamp": row["Time"],
        "unit": row["MeasurementUnit"]
    }

# Loader function that standardizes and processes data
def load_and_standardize(file_path, standardize_func):
    standardized_data = []
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        reader = csv.DictReader(file)
        for row in reader:
            standardized_row = standardize_func(row)
            standardized_data.append(standardized_row)
            # Process each standardized row
            print(f"Processing standardized row: {standardized_row}")
            # Add your specific processing logic here
    return standardized_data

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    standardized_data1 = load_and_standardize('data1.csv', standardize_structure1)
    standardized_data2 = load_and_standardize('data2.csv', standardize_structure2)
```

### Comparison of Strategies

#### Strategy Pattern

**Advantages:**
1. **Flexibility**: Each strategy can be independently developed and modified.
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Different data structures are handled by different strategies, making the code modular.
3. **Extendability**: New data structures can be easily supported by adding new strategies.

**Disadvantages:**
1. **Code Duplication**: Similar logic may be duplicated across different strategies.
2. **Complexity**: Managing multiple strategies can add complexity to the system.

#### Standardization Approach

**Advantages:**
1. **Uniform Processing**: Once data is standardized, the same processing logic can be applied, reducing code duplication.
2. **Simplicity**: One function to load and process data, simplifying the overall design.
3. **Maintainability**: Changes to the processing logic need to be made in only one place.

**Disadvantages:**
1. **Initial Standardization Overhead**: Each data structure requires a standardization function, adding initial development effort.
2. **Tight Coupling**: The standardization functions are tightly coupled with the data structures, making it harder to handle major changes in data format.

### Conclusion

- **Strategy Pattern** is more suitable when the data structures are highly diverse, and there is a need for distinct handling logic for each structure. It promotes flexibility and separation of concerns but can lead to code duplication.
- **Standardization Approach** is effective when the goal is to unify data processing. It simplifies the processing logic by standardizing data first but requires additional effort to create standardization functions.

Both approaches have their merits and can be chosen based on the specific requirements and complexity of the data structures involved.
